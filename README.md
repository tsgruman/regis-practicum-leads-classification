# Introduction
The sales pipeline is an important aspect of any sales and marketing team. It is made of every step in the sales process and is unique to each organization. In general, the sales pipeline begins with lead generation, trying to draw in as many potential customers as possible through advertising, sales calls, and other forms of engagement with the public or target market. It then funnels through steps which may include lead qualificiation, engagement with the customer, quoting, negotiation, purchase, and, in optimal cases, customer loyalty. With each step in the sales pipeline, potential buyers may decide they do not want to continue with the purchase and the funnel narrows through to the last step. Because of this funneling concept, companies try to bolster their lead generation to maximize potential revenue.

Data analysis is becoming an increasingly important tool for sales and marketing professionals. Proper data collection and analysis can provide sales and marketing teams real insight into their customer base and the trajectory of their markets, allowing them to effectively target potential new business, maximize their ROI, and produce a more efficient sales pipeline.
